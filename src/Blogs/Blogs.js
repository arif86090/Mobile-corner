                     <h3> What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h3>
                     <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.</p>

                     <h3> When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb</h3>
                     <p>The powerful Node.js runtime environment has been ranked the technology most commonly used by professional developers. Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime. Node has myriad potential uses for JavaScript development including being a great environment for building efficient network applications.and mongoDb is data storage.we can stored data in mongoDb.if we stored data in mongodb we need node js.so,we used node js.</p>
